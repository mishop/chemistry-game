Chemistry game for android with leadbaord
============

This is the android port of the Chemistry game http://2048alphabet.com/chemistry/ game made by Misho M. Petkovic 

It's nothing fancy, just a java that loads the localy stored html files of the original game. 
App require full internet access permissions and with a quick access icon for my smartphone.
